# pandas-challenge

This analysis was created for an assignment in the Data Science bootcamp through the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. It utilized the panda library, creating data frames and using binning to create descriptive analytics of the data set. 

The code can be found in the PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb file with written analysis at the top. 

I received additional help for this code from https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates.html to learn more on dropping duplicates. All other code is from in-class learning.
